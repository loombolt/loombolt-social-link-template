# Loombolt AI App Template

This is a Loombolt-powered template using a modern stack: **Next.js**, **Shadcn UI**, **Framer Motion**, and **Zustand**.

## What is Loombolt?
Loombolt lets you build web apps by simply chatting with AI. No coding skills neededâ€”just describe what you want, and the AI handles the rest.

## Getting Started

To run the app locally:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to use Loombolt.

You can start editing the app by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
